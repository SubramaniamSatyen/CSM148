# CS M148 Project Repo

This repo contains code for the two projects for UCLA's CS M148 Data Science class - focusing on traditional machine learning techniques and an introduction to neural networks.

## Project 1: SciKit Learn Regression
This project centered around using a regression model to classify Airbnb housing prices using SciKit Learn for data processing and the `LinearRegression()` model. Results can be seen under the "W24_Project1" folder.

## Project 2: SciKit Learn Classification
This project centered around using a classification model to perform binary classification of heart disease using SciKit Learn for data processing and the `SVC()` model. Results can be seen under the "W24_Project2" folder.
